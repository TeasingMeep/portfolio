# places
This project is a growing collection of places I have visited in Philly. When I first moved to the city, I wanted to experience it to the fullest. I started going out constantly. I realized how many places there were and how horrible my memory was. To keep track, I made notes: a collection of places, what they are, a short description to remind myself, and sometimes a picture. I used it as a way to recommend places, find a quick bite, and sometimes a way to remember some good and bad times.

As the list grew, it became increasingly difficult to manage. At work, I had started making filters for a few clients. In my free time, I wanted to build out my portfolio. I realized the list was a dataset; I knew how to create a rudimentary filter, and I wanted to share my exploration of the city.

The list isn't complete. It's going to grow as time goes on. It's going to change too. I have plans to modify, refine, and expand the list. The initial list wasn't intended for the public, so the descriptions won't make sense. Maybe in the future, I'll return to the places, refine the description, and give a proper review.
